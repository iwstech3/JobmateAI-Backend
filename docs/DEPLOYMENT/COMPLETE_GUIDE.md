## 🎯 Overview

### What is Deployment?

**Deployment** means putting your application online so it can be accessed by users over the internet. Instead of running on your local computer, it runs on a server in the cloud.

### Why Deploy?

- ✅ **Accessibility**: Users can access your app from anywhere
- ✅ **Testing**: Test your app in a real environment
- ✅ **Integration**: Frontend can connect to backend API
- ✅ **Demonstration**: Show your work to stakeholders

### What We're Deploying

In this guide, we'll deploy:
1. **Database** (PostgreSQL on Supabase) - Stores all data
2. **Backend API** (FastAPI on Render) - Handles requests and business logic
3. **CI/CD** (GitHub Actions) - Automates future deployments

### Architecture Overview

```
User → Frontend (Vercel) → Backend API (Render) → Database (Supabase)
```

**Why this architecture?**
- **Separation of concerns**: Each part has a specific role
- **Scalability**: Can scale each part independently
- **Free tier**: All services offer free plans for MVP

## 🗂️ Step 1: Database Setup (Supabase)

### What is Supabase?

**Supabase** is a platform that provides a PostgreSQL database hosted in the cloud. Think of it as a database server that you don't need to manage yourself.

### Why Supabase?

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Free Tier** | 500 MB free - perfect for MVP |
| **PostgreSQL** | Compatible with our backend (uses PostgreSQL) |
| **Easy Setup** | No server management needed |
| **Connection URL** | Provides ready-to-use database connection string |

### What is PostgreSQL?

**PostgreSQL** is a type of database (like MySQL, but more powerful). Our backend uses it to store:
- User accounts
- Job postings
- Applications
- CVs and cover letters

### Detailed Steps

#### 1.1 Create Supabase Account

**What we're doing**: Creating an account to access Supabase services.

**Why**: You need an account to create and manage databases.

**Steps**:
1. **Navigate to**: https://supabase.com
2. **Click**: "Start your project" (top right button)
3. **Choose**: "Sign up with GitHub" (recommended)
   - **Why GitHub?**: Easier - no separate password to remember
   - **Alternative**: Email signup works too
4. **Authorize**: Click "Authorize Supabase" when prompted
   - **What this does**: Allows Supabase to see your GitHub profile (for login only)

**Expected Result**: You're logged into Supabase dashboard.

---

#### 1.2 Create a New Project

**What we're doing**: Creating a new database project.

**Why**: Each project gets its own database. We need one for JobMate AI.

**Steps**:
1. **In dashboard**, click **"New Project"** (green button, top right)

2. **Fill out the form**:

   **Organization**:
   - **What it is**: A group of projects (like a company)
   - **What to do**: Create new or use default
   - **Why**: Organizes multiple projects together

   **Name**:
   - **What it is**: Name of this project
   - **What to enter**: `jobmate-ai` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Why**: Helps identify this project later

   **Database Password**:
   - **What it is**: Password to access the database
   - **What to do**: Create a STRONG password
     - **Example**: `JobMate2025!SecurePass123`
     - **Requirements**: Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
   - **⚠️ CRITICAL**: Write this down! You'll need it later.
   - **Why**: Protects your database from unauthorized access

   **Region**:
   - **What it is**: Where the database server is located
   - **What to choose**: Closest to your users
     - US users → `West US` or `East US`
     - European users → `Europe West`
   - **Why**: Closer = faster response times

   **Pricing Plan**:
   - **What it is**: How much you pay
   - **What to select**: **"Free"** (free tier)
   - **Why**: Free tier is perfect for MVP (500 MB storage)

3. **Click**: "Create new project"

4. **Wait**: 2-3 minutes for project creation
   - **What's happening**: Supabase is setting up your database server
   - **You'll see**: Progress bar showing setup status

**Expected Result**: Project created, you see the project dashboard.

---

#### 1.3 Get the Connection URL

**What we're doing**: Getting the URL that our backend will use to connect to the database.

**Why**: The backend needs this URL to know where the database is and how to connect.

**Steps**:
1. **In left sidebar**, click **"Settings"** (gear icon ⚙️)
   - **What this is**: Project configuration page

2. **Click**: "Database" in the submenu
   - **What this shows**: Database connection information

3. **Scroll down** to "Connection string" section
   - **What this is**: Pre-formatted connection URLs

4. **Select**: "URI" from the dropdown
   - **What URI means**: Uniform Resource Identifier - a standard format for connection strings
   - **Why URI**: It's the format our backend expects

5. **Copy the URL** - it looks like:
   ```
   postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.xxxxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres
   ```
   - **Breaking it down**:
     - `postgresql://` = Protocol (how to connect)
     - `postgres` = Username
     - `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` = Placeholder for password
     - `@db.xxxxx.supabase.co` = Server address
     - `:5432` = Port (PostgreSQL default)
     - `/postgres` = Database name

6. **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your actual password
   - **Example**:
     ```
     Before: postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.xxxxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres
     After:  postgresql://postgres:JobMate2025!SecurePass123@db.xxxxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres
     ```
   - **Why**: The placeholder won't work - you need the real password

7. **Save this URL** somewhere safe (text file, notes app)
   - **Why**: You'll need it in Step 2 to configure the backend

**Expected Result**: You have a complete connection URL like:
```
postgresql://postgres:YOUR_ACTUAL_PASSWORD@db.xxxxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

---

#### 1.4 (Optional) Test the Connection

**What we're doing**: Verifying the database is accessible.

**Why**: Catches connection issues early before deploying backend.

**Tools you can use**:
- **pgAdmin** (desktop app)
- **DBeaver** (desktop app)
- **Supabase SQL Editor** (built-in, in Supabase dashboard)

**Steps** (using Supabase SQL Editor):
1. **In Supabase dashboard**, click "SQL Editor" (left sidebar)
2. **Run a test query**:
   ```sql
   SELECT version();
   ```
3. **If it works**: You'll see PostgreSQL version info
4. **If it fails**: Check your connection URL

**Note**: This step is optional - we can test when deploying the backend.

---

## 🖥️ Step 2: Backend Deployment (Render)

### What is Render?

**Render** is a platform that hosts web applications. Think of it as a server in the cloud that runs your code 24/7.

### Why Render for Backend?

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Free Tier** | Free hosting for web services (with limitations) |
| **Python Support** | Native support for Python/FastAPI |
| **Auto-Deploy** | Automatically deploys when you push to GitHub |
| **Environment Variables** | Easy configuration management |
| **Logs** | See what's happening in real-time |

### What is a Web Service?

**Web Service** = An application that responds to HTTP requests. Our FastAPI backend is a web service that:
- Receives API requests
- Processes them
- Returns JSON responses

### Detailed Steps

#### 2.1 Create Render Account

**What we're doing**: Creating an account to use Render's hosting services.

**Why**: You need an account to create and manage web services.

**Steps**:
1. **Navigate to**: https://render.com
2. **Click**: "Get Started for Free" (top right)
3. **Choose**: "Sign up with GitHub" (recommended)
   - **Why GitHub?**: Easier integration, no separate password
4. **Authorize**: Click "Authorize Render" when prompted
   - **What this does**: Allows Render to access your GitHub repos (for deployment)

**Expected Result**: You're logged into Render dashboard.

---

#### 2.2 Create a New Web Service

**What we're doing**: Creating a web service that will host our backend API.

**Why**: This is where our FastAPI application will run and be accessible on the internet.

**Steps**:
1. **In dashboard**, click **"New +"** (top right button)
2. **Select**: "Web Service"
   - **What this is**: A service that runs continuously and responds to HTTP requests
   - **Alternative options**: 
     - "Static Site" = For frontend (we'll use Vercel for that)
     - "Background Worker" = For scheduled tasks (not needed now)

3. **Connect GitHub Repository**:
   - **If first time**: Click "Connect account" and authorize
   - **Select repository**: `iwstech3/JobmateAI-Backend`
     - **Why this repo**: Contains our backend code
   - **Select branch**: `main` (or the branch you want to deploy)
     - **Why main**: This is our production branch

**Expected Result**: Repository connected, ready to configure.

---

#### 2.3 Configure the Service

**What we're doing**: Telling Render how to build and run our application.

**Why**: Render needs to know:
- Where the code is
- How to install dependencies
- How to start the application

**Configuration Fields**:

1. **Name**: `jobmate-ai-backend`
   - **What it is**: Name shown in Render dashboard
   - **Why**: Helps identify this service
   - **Can be**: Any name you want

2. **Region**: Choose closest region
   - **What it is**: Where the server is located
   - **Why**: Closer = lower latency
   - **Options**: Oregon (US West), Frankfurt (EU), etc.

3. **Branch**: `main`
   - **What it is**: Which Git branch to deploy
   - **Why**: We deploy from main branch (production code)

4. **Root Directory**: `Backend` ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
   - **What it is**: Where the code is located in the repository
   - **Why**: Our code is in `Backend/` folder, not root
   - **What happens if wrong**: Render won't find the code and deployment fails

5. **Runtime**: `Python 3`
   - **What it is**: Programming language version
   - **Why**: Our backend is written in Python
   - **Render auto-detects**: Usually detects correctly

6. **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **What it is**: Command to install dependencies
   - **Breaking it down**:
     - `pip` = Python package installer
     - `install` = Install packages
     - `-r requirements.txt` = Install from requirements file
   - **Why**: Our backend needs packages like FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, etc.

7. **Start Command**: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
   - **What it is**: Command to start the application
   - **Breaking it down**:
     - `uvicorn` = ASGI server (runs FastAPI)
     - `app.main:app` = Import `app` from `app/main.py`
     - `--host 0.0.0.0` = Listen on all network interfaces
     - `--port $PORT` = Use port from environment variable (Render provides this)
   - **Why**: This is how FastAPI applications are started

8. **Plan**: Select **"Free"**
   - **What it is**: Pricing tier
   - **Limitations**: 
     - Service sleeps after 15 min inactivity (wakes on request)
     - Limited resources
   - **Why**: Perfect for MVP, upgrade later if needed

**Expected Result**: All fields filled, ready to add environment variables.

---

#### 2.4 Configure Environment Variables

**What we're doing**: Setting configuration values that the application needs.

**Why**: These values change between environments (local vs production) and shouldn't be hardcoded.

**What are Environment Variables?**

Environment variables are key-value pairs stored outside your code. They're used for:
- Secrets (passwords, API keys)
- Configuration (database URLs, API endpoints)
- Feature flags

**Why not hardcode?**
- ❌ Security risk (secrets in code)
- ❌ Can't change without redeploying
- ❌ Different values for dev/prod

**Variables to Add**:

1. **`DATABASE_URL`**
   - **Key**: `DATABASE_URL`
   - **Value**: The Supabase connection URL from Step 1.3
     ```
     postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@db.xxxxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres
     ```
   - **What it does**: Tells backend where to find the database
   - **Why needed**: Backend reads this to connect to PostgreSQL
   - **How to add**:
     1. Click "Add Environment Variable"
     2. Key: `DATABASE_URL`
     3. Value: Paste your Supabase URL
     4. Click "Add"

2. **`ENVIRONMENT`**
   - **Key**: `ENVIRONMENT`
   - **Value**: `production`
   - **What it does**: Tells the app it's running in production
   - **Why needed**: App can behave differently (e.g., more logging in dev)
   - **How to add**: Same process as above

3. **`SECRET_KEY`**
   - **Key**: `SECRET_KEY`
   - **Value**: A long random string (we'll generate one)
   - **What it does**: Used for JWT token signing (authentication)
   - **Why needed**: Security - prevents token tampering
   - **How to generate**:
     1. Go to https://randomkeygen.com/
     2. Copy a "CodeIgniter Encryption Keys" (64 characters)
     3. Example: `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0u1v2w3x4y5z6`
   - **How to add**: Same process, paste the generated key

**Expected Result**: Three environment variables added:
- ✅ `DATABASE_URL`
- ✅ `ENVIRONMENT`
- ✅ `SECRET_KEY`

---

#### 2.5 Create and Deploy the Service

**What we're doing**: Creating the service and starting the deployment.

**Why**: This tells Render to build and run our application.

**Steps**:
1. **Scroll to bottom** of the page
2. **Click**: "Create Web Service"
3. **Wait**: 5-10 minutes for deployment
   - **What's happening**:
     1. Render clones your GitHub repo
     2. Installs dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
     3. Starts the application (`uvicorn app.main:app ...`)
     4. Health checks to verify it's running
   - **You'll see**: Build logs in real-time
   - **Watch for**: 
     - ✅ "Build successful"
     - ✅ "Your service is live"

**Expected Result**: Service created, deployment in progress.

---

#### 2.6 Verify the Deployment

**What we're doing**: Confirming the backend is running and accessible.

**Why**: Need to verify everything works before connecting the frontend.

**Steps**:
1. **Wait for**: "Your service is live" message
2. **Note the URL**: Something like `https://jobmate-ai-backend.onrender.com`
   - **What this is**: Public URL where your API is accessible
   - **Format**: `https://[service-name].onrender.com`

3. **Test the API**:
   - **Open in browser**: `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/`
   - **Expected response**:
     ```json
     {
       "message": "JobMate AI API is running",
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "docs": "/docs"
     }
     ```
   - **If you see this**: ✅ Backend is working!

4. **Test API Documentation**:
   - **Open**: `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/docs`
   - **Expected**: Swagger UI (interactive API documentation)
   - **If you see Swagger**: ✅ API is fully functional!

5. **Check Logs** (if needed):
   - **In Render dashboard**, click "Logs" tab
   - **What you'll see**: Application output, errors, requests
   - **Why useful**: Debugging if something goes wrong

**Expected Result**: 
- ✅ Backend URL accessible
- ✅ API responds correctly
- ✅ Documentation available

**📝 Save the backend URL** - you'll need it for frontend deployment!

---

## 🔄 Step 3: CI/CD Setup (GitHub Actions)

### What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** = Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment

- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: 
  - **What**: Automatically test code when pushed
  - **Why**: Catch bugs early
  
- **CD (Continuous Deployment)**:
  - **What**: Automatically deploy when code is merged
  - **Why**: No manual deployment needed

### Why GitHub Actions?

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Free** | Included with GitHub (no extra cost) |
| **Automatic** | Runs on every push/merge |
| **Integrated** | Works seamlessly with GitHub |
| **Flexible** | Can run tests, builds, deployments |

### How It Works

```
You push code → GitHub detects change → GitHub Actions runs → Render redeploys
```

**Note**: Render also has its own auto-deploy from GitHub. GitHub Actions adds:
- Testing before deployment
- Verification steps
- Better visibility

### Detailed Steps

#### 3.1 Understand the Workflow File

**What we're doing**: Understanding what the GitHub Actions workflow does.

**File Location**: `.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml`

**Why this location?**:
- `.github/` = Special folder GitHub recognizes
- `workflows/` = Contains workflow definitions
- `.yml` = YAML format (human-readable configuration)

**What the workflow does**:
1. Triggers on push to `main` branch
2. Checks out the code
3. Sets up Python
4. Installs dependencies
5. (Future) Runs tests
6. Notifies that deployment should happen

**Note**: Render's webhook handles actual deployment. This workflow verifies everything is ready.

---

#### 3.2 Create the Workflow File

**What we're doing**: Creating the GitHub Actions workflow file.

**Why**: This file tells GitHub what to do when code is pushed.

**Steps**:
1. **In your local repository**, navigate to: `JobmateAI-Backend/`
2. **Create folder structure**:
   ```
   .github/
     workflows/
       deploy-backend.yml
   ```
   - **Why this structure**: GitHub looks for workflows in this exact location

3. **Create the file**: `.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml`
   - **Content**: (Already created - see the file)
   - **What it contains**: YAML configuration for the workflow

**Expected Result**: Workflow file created in correct location.

---

#### 3.3 Commit and Push the Workflow

**What we're doing**: Adding the workflow to Git so GitHub can use it.

**Why**: GitHub Actions only runs workflows that are in the repository.

**Steps**:
1. **Check current branch**: Should be on `deployment/ci-cd-setup`
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

2. **Add the file**:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml
   ```

3. **Commit**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for backend deployment"
   ```

4. **Push**:
   ```bash
   git push origin deployment/ci-cd-setup
   ```

**Expected Result**: Workflow file pushed to GitHub.

---

#### 3.4 Verify Workflow is Active

**What we're doing**: Confirming GitHub recognizes the workflow.

**Why**: Need to verify it's set up correctly.

**Steps**:
1. **Go to GitHub**: Navigate to your repository
2. **Click**: "Actions" tab (top navigation)
3. **You should see**: "Deploy Backend to Render" workflow listed
4. **If you see it**: ✅ Workflow is active!

**Expected Result**: Workflow visible in Actions tab.

---

#### 3.5 Test Automatic Deployment

**What we're doing**: Testing that pushing code triggers automatic deployment.

**Why**: Verify the entire CI/CD pipeline works.

**Steps**:
1. **Make a small change**: 
   - Edit `README.md` (add a line)
   - Or update a comment in code

2. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Test automatic deployment"
   git push origin deployment/ci-cd-setup
   ```

3. **Watch GitHub Actions**:
   - Go to "Actions" tab
   - Click on the latest workflow run
   - Watch it execute in real-time

4. **Check Render**:
   - Go to Render dashboard
   - Check if new deployment started
   - (Render auto-deploys on push to connected branch)

**Expected Result**: 
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow runs
- ✅ Render starts new deployment
- ✅ Everything works automatically!

---

## ✅ Step 4: Verification

### What We're Verifying

1. **Database**: Accessible and working
2. **Backend**: Running and responding
3. **CI/CD**: Automatic deployment works
4. **Integration**: Everything connected correctly

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] **Database Connection**:
  - Backend can connect to Supabase
  - Check Render logs for connection errors
  - (If errors, verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct)
